    <h3>Journalism Clubs</h3>
    <p>
        Journalism has always been an activity to almost all the schools because it aims to not only to help students write, but also to help mainstream medias spread valid information
        to be voice to others, and to fight misinformation. Creative Fine Arts has this too! We have two different clubs for campus journalism, Bahaghari for filipino language and The 
        Central Scholar for English language. Experience doesn't matter because as long as you have commitment we will teach you how to write a good school paper. So what are you waiting for? Join now!

        It is relevant for both learners and the school community. For students, it is important because it trains and
